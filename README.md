## Manually Building for Samsung Galaxy Store, Amazon Apps Store

- amazon:
    - `flutter build apk -t lib/env/production.dart --release --build-number`
- samsung:
    - see [AndroidManifest.xml](android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)
    - `flutter build apk -t lib/env/production.dart --release --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64 --split-per-abi --build-number xxx`
    - (this will generate 1xxx and 2xxx versioncodes)

## CI

Currently I have configured https://app.bitrise.io/dashboard/builds for creating iOS builds.

## Development

Some pseudo-secret files (firebase tokens, itunes affiliate tokens, etc.) are encrypted using 
blackbox. These are required for successful building, but can be faked during development.

For production to decrypt install [blackbox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox) and run
`blackbox_postdeploy`.
